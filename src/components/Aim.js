        Growing up in a middle class Indian family involves a lot of
        stereotypes, a lot of labels. People who do a list of "good" are good
        people, those who don't are classified bad. I don't need to list this
        out. We have all heard it, learn it and grown up with it. But once we
        started stepping outside the boundaries of the four walls of our houses,
        we realized, this was not exactly true. We were confused, what we learnt
        did not coincide with what we saw.
        <br />
        <br /> Let's unlearn stereotypes and take people as they come. We don't
        know anyone, so let's not have a preset notion on their character. Let's
        learn to judge less and accept more. You never know who might surprise
        you.
