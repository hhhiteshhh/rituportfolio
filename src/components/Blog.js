          Step 1: Do Your Research
        </span>
        <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg m-4">
          The very first thing you’re going to want to do is do your research.
          If you’re going to write a blog post about best places to travel in
          Thailand, you want to know exactly the places you want to reference,
          and anything else you want to bring up through the post. This is very
          similar to what you would do if you were typing your post as well.
          <br />
          <br />
          The more research you can do before you start dictating, the more
          organized you can be when you go on to create your outline. I
          recommend looking at around three to five of the blog posts that
          already show up on the first page of Google and see how they format
          their posts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Is there a place that all of them are mentioning? Is there a place
          that none of them are mentioning that you could add to your blog post?
          What are some similar questions people are commonly asking? What do I
          mean by that?
          <br />
          <br />
          If you do a Google search you can see that when you type in “best
          places to travel in Thailand,” Google shows that people also ask,
          “What is the best part of Thailand,” “Is Thailand safe right now” and
          more.
          <br />
          <br />
          How to write blog posts faster by using google suggestions If you know
          that people are asking questions like these, you should have a place
          for them in your blog post. Once you’ve done your research and you
          know exactly what you want to write about it’s time to create your
          outline.
        </p>
        <span className="italic font-bold text-xl sm:text-3xl mx-4">
          Step 2: Create Your Outline
        </span>
        <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg m-4">
          This is the most important thing you’re going to have to do when using
          the talk-to-text feature. Without a solid outline you can find
          yourself just rambling. That is the only downside to using the
          talk-to-text feature. When you’re typing you don’t ramble as much
          because you don’t normally type in filler words such as “like” and
          “um.”
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’re going to use the talk-to-text feature, it’ll pick up
          everything you say. So if you commonly use filler words, it’ll add
          those as if it’s part of your blog post.
          <br />
          <br />
          By creating an outline it will help you streamline you’re content.
          What I like to do is make all of my H2 headers before starting my blog
          post. If you don’t know what an H2 header is, just look at this blog
          post. All the title sections that say Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4,
          and Key Takeaways are what’s called H2 headers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now, let’s say I wanted to write a 2000 word blog post. For this post,
          I want to talk about five distinct topics within the post. That means
          I would have five H2 headers. By having all the H2 headers already
          written down, it goes from a 2000 word blog post to five 400-word blog
          posts.
          <br />
          <br />
          This strategy of chunking your blog post into smaller pieces makes the
          writing process much easier. Also, by having the topics you’re going
          to write about already written down, you know exactly what goes into
          each section. This helps you not repeat yourself throughout your post.
        </p>
        <span className="italic font-bold text-xl sm:text-3xl mx-4">
          Step 3: Start Talking
        </span>
        <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg m-4">
          To get the talk-to-text feature you will first need to open up Google
          Docs. From there, click on tools in the top menu. After that scroll
          down to where you see “Voice Typing” as an option. Click on “Voice
          Typing” and a microphone will show up on the top left of your screen.
          Once you click that, Google Docs will start listening to you and
          translating your speech to text.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            When using the talk-to-text feature the key here is to be slow and
            enunciate.{" "}
          </strong>
          Usually, when people start saying things like um, it’s because they’re
          talking too quickly. Even if you slow down, you will still be talking
          much faster than if you were to be typing. It also makes editing much
          easier if you slow down your speech.
          <br />
          <br />
          One thing to keep in mind is that it doesn’t know when to put in
          punctuation. So, you will have to say things like comma, period, and
          new paragraph whenever you want them. While that might be awkward at
          first, you get used to it quickly.
        </p>
        <span className="italic font-bold text-xl sm:text-3xl mx-4">
          Step 4: Edit
        </span>
        <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg m-4">
          Once you finish your blog post, you’re going to have edit your
          mistakes. These mistakes will look much different than if you typed
          your post. You’re going to have to edit out all the filler words that
          you use. Also, the talk-to-text feature isn’t great at deciphering
          homonyms.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you say “allowed” it may think you mean “aloud.” It can even think
          you said, “out loud.” To show you what the talk to text looks like in
          application, I took a screenshot of how my talk to text turned out
          when I pretended to create an intro for this post. I also took a
          screen shot of a typing speed test that I took for comparison. You can
          see the results below.
          <br />
          <br />
          In one minute for the speed typing test, I got 58 words with a 96%
          accuracy. By just sacrificing 1% of accuracy, I was able to produce
          100 more words in the same minute. I even made it harder trying to
          make the intro make sense.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the typing test, I didn’t have to make sense I just had to type
          random words. If I had just talked randomly for one minute I bet I
          would’ve been closer to 200 words.
        </p>
        <span className="italic font-bold text-xl sm:text-3xl mx-4">
          Key Takeaways
        </span>
        <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg m-4">
          While creating the blog post will take you longer than 20 minutes,
          just getting to 2000 words shouldn’t. All the steps I outlined in this
          post you should take regardless if you dictate your posts or write
          them. The only major difference you’ll see is your edits is that
          certain words will have been mispronounced.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you get good at this, the process to write a 2000 word blog post
          should only take an hour. The research should take you 15 minutes, the
          outline should 10 minutes, and the editing no more than 15 minutes. In
          total, that comes out to about an hour.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now, can you see how powerful this strategy is? Remember, the average
          blog post of 2000 words is written in 4 to 6 hours.
          <strong>
            That means you can now do what the average blogger does in just a
            quarter of the time!
          </strong>
          This can free up your time to focus on other ways of growing your
          blog, or by creating more content. It is up to you to decide what’s
          best for your company.
